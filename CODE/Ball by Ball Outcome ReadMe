Problem Statement.
        Ball-by-Ball Prediction. Given a batsman and bowler predict the outcome.

Models:
    1. Random Forest.
        * This is an Ensemble learning technique which uses bagging where the baseline model is Decision Tree.
        * The Dataset is divided into multiple subsets with/without replacement of rows.
        * Later Decision Tree model is run on individual subsets.
        * Finally an aggregation from all the models is taken an given as a final output

        Attributes for the model:
            * Average Score.
            * Strike Rate.
            * Not Outs.
            * 6's
            * 4's

            * Wickets
            * 3 Wickets
            * 4 Wickets
            * Economy
            * Wicket Taking Ability/SR
            * Average

            * Over
            * Ball
            * Stadium (convert categorical to numeric)
            * Extras
            * Batsman Runs
            * Boundary
            * wicket


    2. SVM.
        * Classification can be performed with Support Vector Machine in two methods.
        * One Vs One & One Vs Rest
        * Different kernel functions can be applied and validated in-order to find the best kernel.
        * The same attributes above mentioned will be passed to this model.
